Nomads

A small Java based game where creating the A.I. is the fun part.

About

Using the API (coming soon) and the [SampleDrone](https://github.com/tgrosinger/Nomads-Sample-Drone) create a drone of your own that can destroy all the other drones.
A sucessful drone will be able to gather resources, avoid the law and other malicious drones, and even reproduce to increase it's forces.

Wiki

A wiki with detailed information about creating a custom drone will be coming soon when the game is closer to an Alpha release.

API

An API will be released once the game is closer to an Alpha release.
